# 3. Benefits & Use Cases

Ultimately, all of these qualities combine as one to create a self auditing and trustless public record which can be used as a tool by people and organizations all over the world to conduct their day to day business. Use cases for the blockchain are plentiful and new ones are popping up every single day. At a basic level it features trustless mechanisms for money and data transfer, traceability and the chronological ordering of data. Digital identities can be created to represent data on the chain and provide proof of exactly when a piece of data was created, its history as well as the ability to prove ownership of data through the use of the blockchain’s native public and private key technology.

**Data Verification:** Immutability of the blockchain allows for the creation of a robust audit trail of data hosted on the chain, which can be helpful for situations involving data verification. Searchability is improved as the blockchain can act as a common database for relevant records or even carry pointers to externally hosted data.

Many industries still rely on physical documents to verify data, which is a manual process that is very time consuming and prone to loss of information and errors. Leveraging blockchain technology to speed the digital evolution of various industries that are still heavily reliant on outdated manual verification practices can improve the efficiency and integrity of virtually any process involving data validation.

**Smart Contracts:** Other use cases include smart contracts, which are self-executing applications with the terms and conditions of an agreement written directly into code. The rules and penalties coded into a smart contract do not require the services of a middleman as all obligations are automatically self-enforcing. Smart contracts are great for setting up automated agreements for exchanging different forms of value without conflict or interference from third parties.

**Tokens:** Further still are token protocols, which make it possible to create assets or tokens that are hosted on top of the blockchain. Tokens can be made to represent anything, anywhere from equity in a company to property or even coupons at a grocery store. Tokens are great for seeking investors for business ventures through crowdfunding or initial coin offerings.

**Distributed Autonomous Corporations:** Token protocols also make it possible for distributed autonomous corporations to be created, which are organizations or profit driven companies that exist solely on the blockchain. A distributed autonomous corporation can organize itself in a number of different ways, including allowing token holders governance and decision making power over the business through voting rights and the ability to receive a portion of the company’s profits through dividend distributions.

## Blockchain as Money: Cryptocurrency

It also goes without saying that blockchains have the potential to become large competitors to traditional state sponsored paper fiat money in the form of cryptocurrencies. The first blockchain, Bitcoin, for example was originally invented by Satoshi Nakamoto as a replacement for fiat money, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It is believed by many that with enough time, development and adoption cryptocurrency can eventually rise up to challenge existing financial institutions like central banks, which are responsible for managing monetary policy in various countries.

Where a central bank manages the supply of money in a centralized fashion with decisions being made by a core group of bankers, blockchains instead have strict coded rules about how new supply is introduced into the economy, how much and over how long a period of time. This makes distribution of new supply in cryptocurrencies more controlled and predictable and not subject to the changing opinions of central bankers.

Each blockchain can have its own separate rules regarding inflation of the supply and those rules can only be changed if a majority of network validators around the world agree to the upgrade, which prevents sudden changes from happening and helps maintain trust and stability in the system. In addition to controlled and predictable inflation, the blockchain also has a number of other benefits when being used as money:

**Irreversible:** Transactions are irreversible, which prevents chargeback fraud like seen with credit cards. Transactions also cannot be denied by the network itself.

**Transparency:** All transactions are transparent and easily viewable on the blockchain using tools like block explorers. This allows easy verification of data.

**Pseudonymity:** As long as a user’s personal identity is not linked to the address they use to transact with, their transactions will remain entirely pseudonymous.

**International Payments:** Cross-border trade is easier because payments are quick and not delayed like traditional methods.

**Identity Protection:** Merchants with lax security measures are at risk of losing your stored credit card information to hackers, but with the public and private key technology of blockchains you are protected as vital payment information is no longer stored by merchants.

**Convenience:** There is no need to carry around a bulky wallet. With cryptocurrency your money can easily be transacted with by downloading various wallet apps on your phone.

**Ease of Access:** For those in developing countries who may not have access to traditional banking and exchange systems, cryptocurrencies provide greater access to the rest of the world economy because all that is needed to get started is a phone and an internet connection.

**No Counterparty Risk:** There are no third parties that you need to trust or rely on in order to transact with your money. Due to the peer-to-peer nature of blockchains, you can cut through any middlemen and send your payments directly where they need to go.

**Independent Control:** The automatic nature of transactions from one user to another offers independence from banks and an increased level of control over funds, however this also comes at a cost as greater thought must be put into securing access to those funds.
