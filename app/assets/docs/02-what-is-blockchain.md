# 2. What is a Blockchain?

Ever since the initial launch of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has proliferated throughout the world in many different forms. This new and exciting technology has the potential to impact society in innumerable ways. In this section we will explain what a blockchain really is, how it functions and its core purpose.

## Centralized Private Ledgers

At its core, the Peercoin blockchain is a distributed public ledger. A ledger is a document such as a spreadsheet in which accounts are kept of economic transactions, including credits, debits, and balances. They are generally used to keep track of an individual or organization’s financial standing or other recordable data such as assets, liabilities, income, expenses and capital.

Before the invention of the blockchain, in order for individuals to manage their financial accounts it was necessary for them to place their full trust in a centrally managed third party organization or business which maintained its own private ledger. Examples of services like this include banks, credit card issuers, money transfer services or other financial institutions based on customer or user trust.

A high degree of trust is placed by customers in these centralized services and the people running them, all of whom are human and fallible. The ledger of customer data for each individual organization is kept private and not shared with the public for independent verification. In this outdated model, the customer is forced into a situation where they need to fully trust that the organizations handling their financial accounts are being truthful.

This lack of transparency is a central point of failure because it forces the customer to trust that the organization is acting in their interest and not against them. This requirement to trust without the ability to verify can invite errors, unaccountability and even outright fraud and corruption within an organization, which can eventually impact the customer in a negative way.

## Distributed Public Ledgers

Blockchain technology however completely removes the requirement of the user to place full trust in a centralized organization to accurately manage its own private ledger. The blockchain instead introduces the concept of a shared or distributed public ledger where a copy of the ledger is held by a large group of people all around the world who work together to validate transactions that are initiated by users of the blockchain network. The individuals who carry out this important work are called validators.

Each validator hosts a full copy of the public ledger and operates a node, which is a program that validates incoming transactions and relays them to other nodes. Together, these validators form a global network of nodes that secure the blockchain by preventing fraud from double spending attempts, which is a problem unique to digital currencies that allow a potential attacker to spend the same coins multiple times. Transactions initiated by users of the blockchain are broadcast out to this network of nodes and these transactions are either validated and accepted or detected as a double spending attempt by a malicious user and rejected as invalid.

Rather than trust being concentrated in a central entity to manage its own private ledger without transparency or oversight, the blockchain instead distributes trust both publicly and globally to a wide number of these validators who work to prevent errors, alterations and acts of fraud against the ledger. This open and transparent sharing of the public ledger allows each of these security providers holding a copy of the ledger to independently verify its legitimacy. In this way the public ledger acts as a digitally shared truth about the state of the network.

## The Blockchain

A blockchain can be accurately described as a continuously growing list of individual transaction records called blocks. When combined together these individual blocks of data form the entirety of the public ledger, which consists of all the transactions that have ever taken place on the network.

As transactions are initiated by users of the network they are broadcast out to the network of validation nodes. One by one these transactions are validated, grouped together and recorded into a block which is then attached to the end of the blockchain as the next link in the chain. Therefore every block is linked, forming one long cryptographically secured chain of blocks.

In Bitcoin and Peercoin, about every ten minutes a new block is added onto the chain which contains all the transactions initiated by users of the network over the past ten minutes. Account balances on the public ledger are consistently and automatically updated with each new added block to reflect changes from these transactions.

## Distributed Consensus Protocol

Unlike a centrally managed entity that depends on user trust of authority figures who are capable of errors or intentional acts of fraud, the blockchain is designed with no such central point of failure. Instead user trust is placed in a blockchain’s distributed consensus protocol, which is an automated process responsible for achieving majority agreement among the network’s many validators on whether the public ledger can be considered valid or not. If the majority of validators working to secure the network can verify and agree that the public ledger is accurate and has not been tampered with, then it can be trusted as legitimate and held as absolute truth by all participants of the network.

A private ledger usually comes in the form of an account book or computer file, however a blockchain which hosts the public ledger runs on a coded set of rules called a distributed consensus protocol. This protocol and its underlying rules are entirely responsible for how a blockchain functions as well as its process for validating transactions and blocks. The protocol is also what gives the blockchain its many beneficial qualities, many of which are described below.

**Automated:** Since a blockchain protocol runs on code, security providers do not have to partake in a time consuming process of manually validating transactions and blocks. This means the consensus and verification process of the public ledger is able to be completely automated so that no manual labor is necessary on the part of security validators. From the standpoint of the end user, a submitted transaction is automatically processed by the network. From the standpoint of the security validator, transactions submitted by users of the network are automatically verified and accepted or rejected by the node software they are running.

**Trustless:** This is a significant development as for the first time in history this results in an automated network that is transparent, verifiable and can be trusted by all parties as it is impartial by its very nature. This unbiased or neutral quality of the blockchain is made possible only by the public nature of the ledger and the ability of a large and globally decentralized group of security validators to verify its accuracy.

This prevents the falsification of transactions and leads to a state of trustlessness in which all participants of the network can be assured that their data is guaranteed to be accurate. This state of trustlessness is the core value proposition of the blockchain. In this state the users of the network no longer need to trust anyone because security is automatically handled for them by the blockchain’s consensus protocol. Users only have need to trust that this protocol continues functioning as it was designed to.

**Censorship Resistant:** Censorship resistance is another vital quality of the blockchain. Banks and payment processors for example are centralized entities that have power over their users and are free to censor transactions or freeze funds at will. They can take actions against their users for any reason, but especially if being coerced by governments. The blockchain introduces a level playing field where no one has power over anyone else and censorship of transactions and freezing of funds is not possible.

**Immutable & Tamper Proof:** The blockchain is also immutable, meaning that recorded data is permanent and cannot be altered. This data is therefore locked into the blockchain forever. This immutability makes the blockchain tamper proof, which means attackers, governments or other external threats cannot alter the blockchain or falsify transaction data.
